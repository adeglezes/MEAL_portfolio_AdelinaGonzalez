# Data Security Protocols

This document outlines basic security procedures for working with MEL data in multi-country programs or restrictive environments.

## 1. Data Storage
- Use encrypted drives or secure cloud storage approved by the organisation.
- Avoid storing sensitive data on personal devices unless encrypted.

## 2. Access Control
- Limit access based on role.
- Use strong authentication (e.g., two-factor authentication).
- Keep an audit trail of data access when possible.

## 3. Transmission of Data
- Avoid sending raw data through email or unencrypted channels.
- Use secure transfer systems recommended by the organisation.
- Compress and encrypt files for external sharing.

## 4. Device Security
- Updated operating system and software.
- Password-protected devices.
- Automatic screen lock.
- Antivirus and firewall protection.

## 5. Backup and Recovery
- Regular backups to secure servers.
- Clear procedures for accidental loss or corruption of data.

These protocols strengthen safe practice in MEL work, especially across distributed teams.

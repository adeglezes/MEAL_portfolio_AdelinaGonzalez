# Do No Harm (DNH) Principles in MEL

DNH ensures that MEL activities do not expose participants or partners to risk, particularly in restrictive or sensitive contexts.

## Key Elements

### 1. Context Awareness
- Understand political, social and institutional dynamics.
- Identify risks associated with speaking publicly.

### 2. Safe Data Collection
- Avoid sensitive identifiers unless strictly necessary.
- Adapt tools to minimise risk to respondents.
- Offer anonymous feedback channels.

### 3. Protection of Participants
- Do not pressure individuals to share personal information.
- Avoid collecting data that could put someone at risk.
- Ensure confidentiality in interview and group settings.

### 4. Handling Sensitive Information
- Anonymise data quickly.
- Restrict access to raw qualitative notes.
- Avoid storing identifiable data longer than necessary.

### 5. Responsible Reporting
- Avoid language that could stigmatise groups or individuals.
- Protect identities in written outputs.
- Use aggregated data whenever possible.

DNH helps ensure evidence generation supports safety and does not unintentionally cause harm.

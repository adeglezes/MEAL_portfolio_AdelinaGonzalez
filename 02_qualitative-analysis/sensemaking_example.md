# Sensemaking Example (Simulated)

This example illustrates a collaborative sensemaking activity in a MEL context.

## Step 1: Presentation of Early Findings
Participants reviewed short summaries of qualitative and quantitative results.

## Step 2: Discussion in Small Groups
Respondents identified:
- Unexpected positive and negative changes  
- Differences in implementation across regions  
- Explanations for gaps or inconsistencies in data  

## Step 3: Collective Interpretation
Themes were consolidated into a shared understanding of:
- What is working well  
- What requires attention  
- How assumptions in the Theory of Change should be adjusted  

## Step 4: Immediate Learning Actions
Participants agreed on concrete adjustments to data collection and implementation.

# Coding Framework Example (Simulated)

This example illustrates a basic coding structure used in qualitative MEL work.

## Initial Codes
- Adoption factors  
- Barriers to implementation  
- Perceived benefits  
- Trust in partners  
- Confidence in new practices  

## Axial Categories
- Resource availability  
- Capacity constraints  
- Stakeholder coordination  
- Local perceptions of change  

## Themes
1. **Structural enablers of adoption**  
   Access to inputs, training quality, partner reliability.  

2. **Localized implementation challenges**  
   Logistical barriers, varying institutional support, time constraints.  

3. **Adaptive learning processes**  
   How participants adjust practices and interpret results over time.

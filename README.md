# MEL & Evaluation Portfolio — Adelina González Estrada

This repository contains selected examples of work and academic training in Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL), mixed-methods evaluation, measurement, and data analysis. All data included in this repository is simulated to preserve confidentiality and ensure ethical and responsible use.

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates
- Quantitative analysis in R (data wrangling, descriptive statistics, regression, reliability, validity).
- Measurement and psychometrics (CTT, MTMM, item analysis, scoring methods).
- Qualitative methods (coding frameworks, thematic analysis, participatory evaluation).
- Mixed-methods evaluation (triangulation, contribution analysis, outcome harvesting).
- Monitoring frameworks, indicators, and Theory of Change structures.
- Evaluation architectures including baseline, midline and endline logic.
- Documentation and templates inspired by real MEL workflows.
- Reproducible analytical workflows.
- Ethical guidelines for data handling and simulated datasets.
- Social media audience analytics for digital projects (Metricool).

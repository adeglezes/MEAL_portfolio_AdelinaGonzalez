# Measurement Concepts Summary

This document summarizes key measurement concepts relevant for MEL.

---

## Reliability
Reliability refers to the consistency of measurement.  
Common forms include:

- **Internal consistency** (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha).  
- **Test–retest reliability** (stability over time).  
- **Inter-rater reliability** (consistency across coders or observers).  

Reliable measures reduce random error and strengthen confidence in results.

## Validity
Validity refers to whether an instrument measures what it is intended to measure.

Types of validity:

- **Construct validity** (alignment between concept and indicators).  
- **Criterion-related validity** (association with an external outcome).  
- **Content validity** (coverage of relevant dimensions).  
- **Face validity** (basic appropriateness of items).  

Evidence for validity typically comes from correlations, factor analyses, expert review and theory.

## Classical Test Theory (CTT)
CTT conceptualizes each observed score as:

**Observed Score = True Score + Error**

It provides:
- Reliability coefficients  
- Item-level statistics (difficulty, discrimination)  
- Basic guidance for creating or improving scales

## Multi-Trait Multi-Method (MTMM)
MTMM is used to assess convergent and discriminant validity across:
- different traits (e.g., confidence, knowledge, attitudes)  
- different methods (surveys, observations, interviews)  

Patterns in the MTMM matrix help identify whether the instrument behaves as expected.

## Scoring and Indices
Key considerations when constructing scores:
- Item weighting or equal weighting  
- Scale direction (reverse-coded items)  
- Normalization or standardization  
- Thresholds for interpreting levels of performance  

Measurement concepts strengthen MEL work by ensuring indicators, scales and outcomes are meaningful, interpretable and aligned with program objectives.

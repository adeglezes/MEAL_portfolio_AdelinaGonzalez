# Quantitative Analysis Examples

This folder contains small, self-contained examples of quantitative analysis using simulated data in a Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) context.

The files illustrate:

- Data wrangling and change calculations across countries.
- Descriptive statistics and basic visualizations relevant for reporting.
- Reliability and simple validity checks for a short scale.
- A linear model to explore the relationship between participation and outcomes.
- A Python notebook that simulates and visualizes indicator trends over time.

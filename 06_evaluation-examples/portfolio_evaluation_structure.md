# Multi-Project Portfolio Evaluation Structure

This template summarizes steps for conducting a portfolio-level evaluation across several projects or countries.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope
Define the scope of the portfolio.

Example:
A five-project portfolio implemented across three countries focusing on capacity building, knowledge transfer and resilience.

---

## 2. Evaluation Questions
Examples:
- What results were achieved across projects?
- What lessons can be learned across contexts?
- How did implementation vary across locations?

---

## 3. Data Sources
- Project documents and MEL frameworks.  
- Monitoring indicator datasets.  
- Key informant interviews.  
- Case studies.  
- Field observations.

---

## 4. Analytical Approach
- Comparative analysis across projects and regions.  
- Contribution reasoning supported by data.  
- Thematic synthesis of findings.  
- Integration of qualitative and quantitative insights.

---

## 5. Findings
Organized by evaluation question with cross-country examples.

---

## 6. Learning and Recommendations
Provide actionable, portfolio-wide insights.

Example:
- Strengthen the role of local facilitators through dedicated coaching.
- Improve coordination mechanisms for joint learning.
- Enhance MEL alignment across projects to improve comparability.

This structure can be adapted to different portfolio sizes and thematic areas.

# Baseline–Midline–Endline Structure

A structured monitoring and evaluation approach typically uses three main measurement points: baseline, midline and endline. This supports progress tracking and outcome assessment.

---

## Baseline
- Conducted before activities start.  
- Establishes initial conditions for participants, institutions or systems.  
- Sets reference values for indicators.  
- Informs target-setting and the refinement of the Theory of Change.

**Typical baseline elements:**
- Initial values for key indicators.  
- Contextual information.  
- Identification of risks and assumptions.  

---

## Midline
- Conducted during implementation.  
- Used to check progress, reveal bottlenecks, and validate assumptions.  
- Supports adaptive management.

**Typical midline elements:**
- Comparison with baseline values.  
- Identification of early successes or challenges.  
- Short-term insights to guide program adjustments.  

---

## Endline
- Conducted after the completion of activities.  
- Provides final measurement and supports assessment of contribution.

**Typical endline elements:**
- Final values for indicators.  
- Comparison with baseline and midline.  
- Evidence of change over time.  
- Interpretation of how the program contributed to outcomes.

## Example (Simulated): Yield Adoption Program
- Yield baseline: 2.4 t/ha  
- Yield midline: 2.9 t/ha  
- Yield endline: 3.2 t/ha  

- Adoption baseline: 18%  
- Adoption midline: 37%  
- Adoption endline: 53%  

Interpretation: Evidence suggests a positive upward trend in both adoption and yield, aligned with program assumptions.

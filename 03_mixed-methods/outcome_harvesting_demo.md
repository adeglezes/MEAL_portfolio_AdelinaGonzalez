# Outcome Harvesting Example (Simulated)

Outcome harvesting identifies changes in behavior, relationships or actions that may not have been anticipated in the original design.

## Step 1: Identify Outcomes
Examples of outcomes (simulated):
- Local extension teams introduced new record-keeping practices.
- Farmers formed informal knowledge-sharing groups.
- Partner organizations integrated gender considerations in local planning.

## Step 2: Describe Contribution
Evidence indicates that:
- Training sessions provided relevant tools.
- Follow-up visits encouraged application.
- Partners valued opportunities to discuss learning.

## Step 3: Verify
Verification sources:
- Interviews with participants
- Notes from learning sessions
- Monitoring records

## Step 4: Analyse
Patterns from outcome harvesting can highlight:
- Unintended positive effects
- Strengthened local partnerships
- Emerging changes not captured by indicators

Outcome harvesting complements indicator tracking by revealing unexpected pathways of change.

# Triangulation Example (Simulated)

Triangulation increases credibility by examining how different data sources relate to each other.

## Data Streams
1. **Quantitative indicators**
   - Yield change
   - Income change
   - Participation rates

2. **Qualitative insights**
   - Narrative accounts from interviews
   - Perceptions of usefulness of training
   - Reported challenges and enablers

3. **Administrative or monitoring data**
   - Attendance sheets
   - Training records
   - Implementation timelines

## Triangulation Table

| Evaluation Question                           | Quantitative Data | Qualitative Data | Administrative Data | Interpretation |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Did adoption increase?                         | Moderate increase | Adoption drivers | Consistent records   | Convergent     |
| Was training relevant and useful?              | Participation +   | High usefulness  | Regular attendance   | Convergent     |
| Were there implementation differences by site? | Country variation | Local challenges | Different schedules  | Complementary  |

## Summary Interpretation
Converging evidence across data types suggests that capacity-building activities contributed to increases in adoption. Differences across regions highlight context-specific challenges that should inform adaptation.

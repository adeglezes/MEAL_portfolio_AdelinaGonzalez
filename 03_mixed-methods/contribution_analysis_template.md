# Contribution Analysis Template

This template outlines a basic structure to build a contribution narrative in a MEL context.

## 1. Define the Intended Change
Describe the main outcome the program aimed to influence.

Example (simulated):
“Improve adoption of climate-resilient practices among smallholder farmers.”

## 2. Outline the Theory of Causality
List expected causal links:
- Training increases knowledge
- Knowledge improves confidence
- Confidence supports adoption
- Adoption leads to improved resilience

## 3. Identify Other Influencing Factors
Examples:
- Market conditions
- Local policies
- Environmental or seasonal variation
- Other interventions in the area

## 4. Assemble Evidence
Use:
- Quantitative indicators
- Qualitative interview data
- Administrative records
- Field observations

## 5. Assess Contribution
Interpret whether the program contributed to the observed changes, and how strongly.

## 6. Present the Contribution Narrative
Summarize:
- What changed
- How the program contributed
- What other factors played a role
- What is uncertain or requires more data

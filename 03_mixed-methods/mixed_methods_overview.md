# Mixed-Methods Overview

Mixed-methods evaluation combines quantitative and qualitative evidence to provide a deeper and more credible understanding of program performance.

## When Mixed Methods Are Useful

- When stakeholder perspectives are essential to interpreting results.
- When unexpected or emergent outcomes need to be documented.
- When triangulation is required to strengthen evidence.

## Benefits

# MAE4001 — Linear Models Summary

MAE4001 covers linear regression and model-based inference, with applications relevant for evaluation contexts.

## Key Competencies
- Simple and multiple linear regression.
- Model specification and selection.
- Diagnostics: assumptions, residuals and fit.
- Interpretation of coefficients and confidence intervals.
- Using models to understand relationships between program participation and outcomes.
- Connecting regression to causal reasoning (when appropriate).

## Application to MEL
Linear models can be used to:
- Estimate change in outcomes controlling for baseline characteristics.
- Explore associations between training and performance.
- Identify predictors of adoption or engagement.
- Support triangulation alongside qualitative insights.

The script in this portfolio illustrates modelling of simulated yield change as a function of training hours.

# MAE Coursework — Data Science, Linear Models & Measurement

This folder contains selected examples and summaries from graduate-level coursework in the Master’s in Assessment, Measurement and Evaluation (MAE).

The material illustrates competencies relevant for MEL roles, including:

- Data wrangling and reproducible analysis in R.
- Linear models and interpretation of coefficients for applied evaluation.
- Measurement concepts such as reliability, validity and Classical Test Theory.
- Conceptual links between measurement theory and MEL practice.

All examples use simulated data to ensure confidentiality.

# MAE4011 — Principles of Measurement Summary

MAE4011 introduces core principles of measurement used in social sciences, education and evaluation.

## Key Competencies
- Reliability: internal consistency, stability and inter-rater agreement.
- Validity evidence: construct, criterion-related and content validity.
- Classical Test Theory (CTT) and item statistics.
- Score construction and interpretation.
- Factor analysis for examining scale structure.
- Multi-trait multi-method (MTMM) arguments for construct validity.

## Application to MEL
Measurement is essential for ensuring that:
- Indicators reflect the intended constructs.
- Scales are internally consistent and interpretable.
- Monitoring data accurately represents change.
- Tools such as surveys or assessments are valid in context.

The example in this portfolio includes reliability testing and a simple one-factor exploration using simulated data.

**Title:** Confidence, Knowledge and Adoption: Understanding Behavioural Drivers in Smallholder Settings

**Purpose:**  
To explore how confidence and perceived usefulness influence the adoption of improved practices among smallholder farmers.

**Methods:**  
Data were collected through semi-structured interviews (n = 22) and a structured survey (n = 180). The analysis used thematic coding, descriptive statistics and a simple regression model controlling for baseline variation.

**Findings:**  
Participants with higher confidence scores demonstrated greater likelihood of early adoption. Qualitative evidence suggests that peer learning and follow-up guidance strengthened motivation, especially among women participants.

**Implications:**  
Results highlight the importance of targeted coaching and context-specific facilitation in enabling adoption. The study demonstrates how mixed-methods approaches provide a more nuanced understanding of behavioural change than indicators alone.

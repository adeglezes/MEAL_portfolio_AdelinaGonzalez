# Academic Research

This folder contains examples of academic research formats relevant to Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL).  
The materials illustrate:

- A generic research abstract.  
- A structure for presenting empirical findings.  
- A literature review synthesis template.  
- A methodological appendix with sampling, ethics and analysis notes.  
- A short conceptual paper linking research to MEL practice.  

All examples use simulated content or generalized structures.
